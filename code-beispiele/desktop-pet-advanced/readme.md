## How to run a pet

go run . <path to images of pet> <scale>

- path to images of pet is optional: default is assets/pet-1
- scale is optional: default is 0.3

### Examples 

```
go run . assets/pet-1 0.3
```

```
go run . assets/pet-2 0.8
```


### TODOs: 

1) Pet should not leave the screen area 
2) Different 'walk' modi. ex: pet just walks on the screen bottom.
